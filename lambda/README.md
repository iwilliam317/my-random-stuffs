# Lambdas in Javascript

a characteristic of a lambda expression is that it is used as data. That means that the function is passed as an argument to another function, returned as a value from a function, or assigned to variables or data structures.

Notes: not all lambdas are anonymous, and not all anonymous functions are lambdas!
