# React

React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript, so a transpiler is required


* Simple JSX Element

```
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
  </div>
); 
```
