# HTML Semantic
Essencial for SEO's and assistive technologies

## Applied Accessibility

*  Wrap Content

```
<div> - groups content
<section> - groups related content
<article> - groups independent, self-contained content
```

* Add a Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility
```
<img src="cat.jpeg" alt="My cat description"> - should provide a correspondent description for image. 
```

* Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the header Landmark
```
<header> - allows assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content. Take place in the top of <body>
```
